Although the course can be audited for free, in that case, there will be no deadlines for assignment submission and no certificate of course completion as well. These two factors are very important and motivate one to complete the course, that too on time. Without these, I may start the course fully motivated but I will surely lose my motivation with time. Also, I will not be able to judge my performance as there will be no scale to measure it.  This stands as a secondary reason why I am applying for the financial aid.")

My branch of study is Computer Science and Engineering and I love to enhance my skills in this field as much as possible. In todayâ€™s world, "+keyword+" has a vast scope and an excellent future. I personally believe that completing this course would be a good head start for stepping into the world of "+keyword+".

Moreover, if I am provided with the financial aid, I promise to complete my assignments on time and even help my peers, who are taking the same course, in clearing their doubts. Not only this, but I will also spread mass awareness about Coursera in my college; mostly among my juniors and batchmates, so that they can learn from such an amazing platform as this. Although I am not able to pay for the course with money, I will try to compensate for the same through indirect contribution in the form of promotions of the Coursera platform.")
